**TheSynthDoctor - Streamlining Synthesizer Repairs**

Welcome to TheSynthDoctor, your go-to platform for seamless synthesizer repairs. As a freelance repair technician, I understand the challenges of managing repair requests efficiently. That's why I collaborated with a dedicated team to develop this comprehensive web application during a bootcamp project. Here's an overview of how TheSynthDoctor simplifies the repair process:

**Key Features:**

  Users can submit repair requests, providing essential details about the issue and the synthesizer in question. These requests are directed to the admin, streamlining the process for users and technicians alike.

- **Comprehensive Case Management:**
  - **Open Cases:** View cases that are pending acceptance or delivery, along with those requiring additional information before proceeding.
  - **In-Shop Cases:** Monitor synthesizers currently in the repair shop, ensuring efficient workflow management.
  - **Closed and Pickup Cases:** Track completed cases and those awaiting pickup by the owners.

- **Efficient Case Handling:**
  - **Parts Management:** Easily add parts to a case, utilizing the Mouser API as the database, with the associated cost and total calculated automatically.
  - **Time Tracking:** Utilize a timer to calculate active work time, assisting in accurate billing based on hourly rates.
  - **Internal Messaging:** Maintain a detailed log of case-related notes, aiding in tracking repairs and facilitating future maintenance.

**Development Details:**

- **Technological Stack:** TheSynthDoctor is built using JavaScript, Handlebars, Node.js, Express, and Bootstrap for styling. Custom CSS classes enhance the user interface and experience.

- **Effective Team Collaboration:** As the team leader, I strategically distributed tasks based on team members' skills, ensuring efficient progress. By addressing challenging aspects first and fostering a supportive environment, we completed the project two weeks ahead of schedule.
